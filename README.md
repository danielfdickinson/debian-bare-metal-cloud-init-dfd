# DFD Debian Bare Metal Cloud-Init

Daniel F. Dickinson's Cloud-Init deployment for a bare-metal host for
a 'personal infrastructure'. This repository provides the base configuration
upon which Ansible will build.

The base configuration is very basic and aims to act like an OVH Debian 11
(Bullseye) dedicated server's base configuration.

This repository should not include any private or even particularly personalised
information in unencrypted form. It does, however, depend on adding some (to be
documented) values (or to be authorised to view the encrypted data).

It is still designed for DFD's uses and is likely not a 'plug and play' option
for others. It is Daniel's hope, however, that it still proves informative and
useful.
